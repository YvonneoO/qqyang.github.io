## Introduction

The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) highlights their environmental benefits, especially when charged with renewable energy. However, traditional EV charging processes pose significant challenges:
- **Limited Range**: EVs require frequent charging compared to refueling combustion engine vehicles.
- **User Inconvenience**: Manual charging can be cumbersome in bad weather and inaccessible to disabled or elderly individuals.

This project aims to design an automated EV charging system to address these issues, improving convenience and accessibility while supporting broader EV adoption.

## Objectives

The main objectives for this project include:
- **Automation**: Streamline the charging process from vehicle parking to connector engagement without human intervention.
- **Accessibility**: Enhance usability for a broader demographic, including disabled and elderly users.
- **Efficiency**: Ensure optimal charging speed and alignment for energy transfer.
- **Feasibility**: Design a system that is both economically viable and implementable with current technology.


## Design

Key aspects of the design:
- **Precision Positioning**: Ensure precise vehicle alignment with the charging port using sensor arrays and guided parking.
- **Flexibility**: Accommodate various EV models.
- **Technology**: Leverage computer vision and robotics for object detection and path planning.
- **User Experience**: Prioritize safety, reliability, and ease of use through real-time monitoring and mobile feedback.

### Features
- **Robotic Arm**: For precise positioning and path planning.
- **Guided Parking System**: Using sensor arrays for alignment.
- **Mobile Application**: Real-time monitoring and user feedback.

### My Contribution

My part of work is mainly the literature review of current EV charging methods and the mechanical model design of our system.

## Evaluation

The proposed system's functionality was tested at an algorithmic level, focusing on:
- **Precision**: Robotic arm and guided parking system.
- **Reliability**: Safe operation under various environmental conditions.
- **User Interaction**: Mobile application usability.


## Conclusion

The automated EV charging system demonstrates significant potential to improve user convenience and accessibility while promoting sustainable transportation. Although conceptual at this stage, the design addresses key challenges in EV charging and provides a foundation for future real-world implementation.
