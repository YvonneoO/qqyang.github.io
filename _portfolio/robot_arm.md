This project involved the assembly and development of a 3-DOF robotic arm capable of performing complex pick-and-place tasks. Forward and inverse kinematics calculations were implemented using MATLAB for precise position control, while trajectory planning was integrated using cubic polynomials to ensure smooth motion. The robotic arm was programmed with Arduino, allowing it to autonomously execute predefined trajectories and handle objects efficiently.
